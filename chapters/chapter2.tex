\section{Pain}
Pain, in its various forms, represents a significant burden on a person's quality of life. The unpleasant feeling it provokes may result in functional disability or even a change of behaviour, making an individual feel anger and frustration \cite{Dirk2021}. According to its duration, pain can be classified as acute or chronic. Acute pain is induced by the activation of nociceptor sensory neurons, which occurs in the presence of potentially damaging stimuli, such as intense heat or cold and excessive mechanical force, or due to inflammation \cite{Jayakar2021}. On the other hand, chronic pain is defined as lasting more than three months and having some kind of central sensitization \cite{Raman2022}. (Falar dos 3 tipos de dor cr√≥nica)
